BeerList
Author:  Greggory Rothmeier (greggroth@gmail.com)

Site to organize the hundreds of beer lists around Atlanta into one easy to navigate interface.  There are pages for viewing what beers a bar has, a page for each beer (including a list of all of the bars that beer is being served at, sorted by price), and a page for each brewery (including all of the beers/bars their beer is served at).  Much more to come.  This is only the beginning!!
